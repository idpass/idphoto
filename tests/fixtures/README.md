# Test Fixtures

The images in this directory are **AI-generated synthetic portraits** created
specifically for testing. They do not depict real people.

These fixtures are used by the integration test suite to verify face detection,
cropping, and compression across different image formats, orientations, and
compositions.

## Directory Structure

- `*.png` / `*.webp` / `*.jpg` — source test images
- `offcenter/` — variants with faces positioned off-center (right, bottom-right, wide)
- `output/` — reference outputs generated by `generate_samples` example
